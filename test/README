This directory contains language and regression tests for Coldmud.  To
run the tests, do

	sh test-coldmud.sh ../src/coldmud

(This assumes that there is a coldmud executable in ../src; otherwise,
give the pathname of a coldmud executable.)

See NOTES for notes on the tests.  See TRACKING for bug-tracking
information used to write the regression tests.
