This is the 0.10 release of Coldmud, a multi-user disk-based
object-oriented programmable network database server.  It is still
under development.

No core database is distributed with the server; the Cold World core
database is distributed separately.

The 'test' directory contains a test suite containing language and
regression tests, as well as bug-tracking information.

Questions should go to the author, Greg Hudson, whose email address is
ghudson@mit.edu.  To join the coldmud discussion list, send mail to
coldstuff-request@mit.edu.
