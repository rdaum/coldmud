<H2>Inheritance</H2>

In addition to the methods an object defines for itself, objects inherit
methods from their <EM>parents</EM>.  An object can override a parent's
method by defining its own methods with the same name.<P>
<P>
The root object has no parents.  All other objects have at least one
parent, and eventually inherit from the root object.  The root object
has the dbref <CODE>1</CODE>.<P>
<P>
It is easy to determine how an object with one parent will react to a
message; either the object defines its own method for that message, or
it uses the inherited method from its parent.<P>
<P>
Objects with more than one parent are more complicated.  Ancestors of
such an object take precedence over each other according to the
following rules:<P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Any ancestor object has higher precedence than its own ancestors.<P>

<LI>The first parent of an object and the first parent's ancestors have
higher precedence than the second parent and the second parent's
ancestors, and so on, except when this conflicts with the first rule.<P>

</OL>

Normally, an object's response to a message is determined by checking
its own method definitions, and then those of its ancestors in order of
decreasing precedence (<A HREF="Inheritance-Footnotes.html">footnote 1</A>).  However, it is possible for a method to disallow
overrides.  If one or more ancestors of an object define non-overridable
methods, then Coldmud will select the non-overridable method defined on
the ancestor with the least precedence.<P>
