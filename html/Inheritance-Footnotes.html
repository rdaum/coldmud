(1)  Because of Coldmud's precedence rules,
its multiple-inheritance scheme can be described loosely as
``left-to-right, up-to-join''.  That is, Coldmud performs a depth-first
traversal of the ancestors digraph, ordering the parents from left to
right, stopping at an ancestor if it will reach the ancestor again later
in the traversal.
