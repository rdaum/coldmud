<H2>Statements</H2>

<EM>Statements</EM> are instructions to the interpreter.  Statements can
be as simple as comments, or they can be complex loops and conditionals.
However, most statement types in <CODE>C--</CODE> have simple structures.
Because statements can include other statements, you can use these
simple statement types to build complex directives.<P>
<P>
The following sections describe simple statements, which perform simple
actions once, conditional statements, which perform different actions
depending on the value of an expression, looping statements, which
perform an action multiple times, and error-handling statements, which
affect how the interpreter handles error conditions.<P>
