<H3>Calling Functions</H3>

A <CODE>C--</CODE> method can call a built-in function using a <EM>function
call expression</EM>, which has the following syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>function-name</VAR>(<VAR>arg1</VAR>, <VAR>arg2</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR>)
</PRE
>
<VAR>function-name</VAR> is an identifier naming the function, and
<VAR>arg1</VAR>, <VAR>arg2</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR> are expressions.  There do not have to
be any arguments, but you must include the parentheses even if there are
no arguments.  The arguments are evaluated from left to right.<P>
<P>
As an example, the <CODE>pad()</CODE> function pads a string argument with
spaces to a certain length.  The following expression has the value
<CODE>"foo "</CODE>:<P>


<PRE>
pad("foo", 6);
</PRE
>
Coldmud's built-in functions allow you to perform string and list
operations, modify and retrieve information from the current object,
perform administrative tasks, among other things.  For descriptions of
the available functions, see <A HREF="Function_Descriptions.html">Function Descriptions</A>.<P>
<P>
For various reasons, functions can throw errors. For instance, calling a
function with an incorrect number of arguments causes a <CODE>~numargs</CODE>
error, and calling a function with arguments of incorrect type causes a
<CODE>~type</CODE> error.  See <A HREF="Errors.html">Errors</A> for information on how to handle
errors.<P>
