<H3>Data Types</H3>

Every piece of data in <CODE>C--</CODE> has a type.  This section documents
the data types in <CODE>C--</CODE>.  You can produce values of the simpler
data types (integers, strings, dbrefs, symbols, error codes) can be
produced with <VAR>literal</VAR> expressions; you can produce values of the
more complex data types (lists, dictionaries, frobs, buffers) with
<VAR>constructor</VAR> expressions.  As we go, we will explain how to specify
or construct values of each of the data types, and explain what it means
for a value of each data type to be true.<P>
<P>
Every piece of data in <CODE>C--</CODE> has a type and a truth value.  The
type can be one of:<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Integer
<LI>String
<LI>Dbref
<LI>List
<LI>Symbol
<LI>Error type
<LI>Frob
<LI>Dictionary
<LI>Buffer
</UL>

An <EM>integer</EM> is just a number.  Integers can reliably be from
-2147483648 to +2147483647.  An integer is true if it is not zero.  You
can denote integer literals in <CODE>C--</CODE> by writing a sequence of
digits, optionally preceded by a <SAMP>-</SAMP> or <SAMP>+</SAMP> sign.<P>
<P>
A <EM>string</EM> is a sequence of printable characters.  A string is true
if it is not empty.  You can denote string literals in <CODE>C--</CODE> by
enclosing a sequence of characters in double quotes (<SAMP>"</SAMP>).  To
include a double quote or backslash character in a string literal,
precede it by a backslash (<SAMP>\</SAMP>).  The following are string
literals:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
"foo"
"\"foo\" is a metasyntactic variable."
"The backslash (`\\') is a much-abused character in many languages."
</PRE

A <EM>dbref</EM> is a reference to an object, which may or may not exist.
Database references are always true, whether or not they refer to actual
objects.  You can denote dbref literals in <CODE>C--</CODE> by preceding a
number with a sharp (<SAMP>#</SAMP>); for example, <CODE>#1</CODE> and <CODE>#267</CODE>
are valid dbref literals.<P>
<P>
A <EM>list</EM> is a collection of objects of any type.  Lists are useful
for manipulating several objects at once.  A list is true if it is not
empty.  You can construct a list value by enclosing a comma-separated
series of expressions in square brackets; for example, <CODE>[1, 2, 3]</CODE>
and <CODE>[1, ["foo", 'bar], #23]</CODE> are valid list construction
expressions.<P>
<P>
A <EM>symbol</EM> is a symbolic value.  You can denote symbols in
<CODE>C--</CODE> by preceding an identifier or string with an apostrophe
(<SAMP>'</SAMP>).  <CODE>'remote</CODE>, <CODE>'template</CODE>, and <CODE>'object</CODE> are
valid symbol literals.  Symbols are always true.<P>
<P>
An <EM>error code</EM> identifies a type of error condition.  Both the
<CODE>C--</CODE> interpreter and <CODE>C--</CODE> methods use error codes to
identify types of errors when they occur.  See <A HREF="Errors.html">Errors</A> for
information about how Coldmud handles errors.  You can denote error code
literals in <CODE>C--</CODE> by preceding an identifier or string with a tilde
(<SAMP>~</SAMP>).  Error codes are always false.<P>
<P>
A <EM>frob</EM> consists of a <EM>class</EM>, the dbref of an object, and a
<EM>representation</EM>, a list or dictionary.  Frobs are intended to
serve as lightweight objects.  You can construct a frob value by
enclosing expressions for the class and representation in triangular
brackets, separated by a comma; for instance, <CODE><#73, [1, 2]></CODE> is a
valid frob construction expression.  Frobs are always true.<P>
<P>
A <EM>dictionary</EM> is a collection of <EM>associations</EM>, each of
which has a <EM>key</EM> and a <EM>value</EM>.  Dictionaries take up more
space than lists, but searching for a data value in a dictionary is
generally faster than searching for data values in lists.  You can
construct a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated series of
associations in square brackets, where each association is a two-element
list giving a key and a value, and preceding the whole thing with a hash
mark (<SAMP>#</SAMP>).  For instance, <CODE>#[["foo", 3], ["bar", 'baz]]</CODE> is a
valid dictionary construction expression.  A dictionary is true if it is
not empty.<P>
<P>
a <EM>buffer</EM> is an array of unsigned eight-bit values, intended for
network I/O.  You can construct a buffer by enclosing a comma-separated
series of integer expressions in square brackets, preceded by a percent
sign (<SAMP>%</SAMP>).  For instance, <CODE>%[65, 66, 67, 10]</CODE> is a valid
buffer construction expression.  A buffer is true if it is not empty.<P>
<P>
You can get the type of a piece of <CODE>C--</CODE> data using the
<CODE>type()</CODE> function.  The <CODE>type()</CODE> function returns a symbol
corresponding to the type of its argument.  This symbol can be
<CODE>'integer</CODE>, <CODE>'string</CODE>, <CODE>'dbref</CODE>, <CODE>'list</CODE>,
<CODE>'symbol</CODE>, <CODE>'error</CODE>, <CODE>'frob</CODE>, or <CODE>'dictionary</CODE>.<P>
