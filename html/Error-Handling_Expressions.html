<H3>Error-Handling Expressions</H3>

<CODE>C--</CODE> provides two kinds of expressions for handling errors in
expressions.  These are the <EM>critical expression</EM> and the
<EM>propagation expression</EM>.<P>


The <EM>critical expression</EM> allows you to ignore errors which occur
inside an expression.  It has the following syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
(| expression |)
</PRE
>
If an error occurs in <VAR>expression</VAR>, then the interpreter will stop
evaluating <VAR>expression</VAR>, and continue to execute the current method
as if it had succeeded evaluating <VAR>expression</VAR>.  The value of
<VAR>expression</VAR> will be the error code for the error condition which
occurred.<P>
<P>
The <EM>propagation expression</EM> allows you to indicate that any errors
which occur inside an expression are the responsibility of the calling
routine.  It has the following syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
(> expression <)
</PRE
>
If an unhandled error occurs in <VAR>expression</VAR>, then it will propagate
to the calling routine as itself, instead of as <CODE>~methoderr</CODE>.<P>
<P>
Critical expressions override the behavior of catch statements, so that
errors which occur within critical expressions do not trigger catch
error handlers.  Propagation expressions do not override critical
expressions or catch statements, however; they do not prevent errors
from being caught, but only determine how errors propagate if they are
not caught.<P>
