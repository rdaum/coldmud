<H3>Buffers</H3>

A <EM>buffer</EM> is a vector of unsigned eight-bit values, intended
primarily for network I/O.  Although they are not as convenient to use
as strings, they can contain any character value, while strings can
contain only printable characters.<P>
<P>
You can construct a buffer using a <EM>buffer construction
expression</EM>, which has the following syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
%[<VAR>byte1</VAR>, <VAR>byte2</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR>]
</PRE
>
The result of a buffer construction expression is a buffer containing
the byte values expressed by <VAR>byte1</VAR>, <VAR>byte2</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR>, all of
which must be integers.  If any of the values of <VAR>byte1</VAR>,
<VAR>byte2</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR> cannot fit inside an unsigned eight-bit number,
then that byte will contain the lower order eight bits of the specified
number.<P>
<P>
Apart from operations which apply to all data types, the only language
operations which apply to buffers are the functions whose names begin
with <SAMP>buffer_</SAMP>: <CODE>buffer_len()</CODE>, <CODE>buffer_retrieve()</CODE>,
<CODE>buffer_append()</CODE>, <CODE>buffer_replace()</CODE>, <CODE>buffer_add()</CODE>,
<CODE>buffer_truncate()</CODE>, <CODE>buffer_to_strings()</CODE>, and
<CODE>buffer_from_strings()</CODE>.  The last two functions allow you to
convert between buffers and lists of strings.<P>

Coldmud passes data between the object heirarchy and network connections
in terms of buffers; see <A HREF="Connections.html">Connections</A> for details.<P>
