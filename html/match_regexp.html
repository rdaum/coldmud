match_regexp(<VAR>regexp</VAR>, <VAR>string</VAR>, [<VAR>case_matters</VAR>])
</PRE
>
This function matches the regular expression <VAR>regexp</VAR>, a
string,against the string <VAR>string</VAR>.  If <VAR>case_matters</VAR> is
specified and is true, the match is case-sensitive; otherwise, it is
case-insensitive.  If the match succeeds, <CODE>match_regexp()</CODE> returns
a ten-element list giving the substitutions for the match (see below);
otherwise, <CODE>match_regexp()</CODE> returns 0.<P>
<P>
Coldmud uses a regular expression matcher written by Henry Spencer.  Its
syntax is very similar to the regular expression syntax used by Unix
utilities like <CODE>ed</CODE> or <CODE>egrep</CODE>.  Here is Spencer's description
of his regular expression syntax:<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A regular expression is zero or more branches, separated by <SAMP>|</SAMP>.
It matches anything that matches one of the branches.<P>
<P>
A branch is zero or more pieces, concatenated.  It matches a match for
the first, followed by a match for the second, etc.<P>
<P>
A piece is an atom possibly followed by <SAMP>*</SAMP>, <SAMP>+</SAMP>, or <SAMP>?</SAMP>.
An atom followed by <SAMP>*</SAMP> matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of
the atom.  An atom followed by <SAMP>+</SAMP> matches a sequence of 1 or more
matches of the atom.  An atom followed by <SAMP>?</SAMP> matches a match of
the atom, or the null string.<P>
<P>
An atom is a regular expression in parentheses (matching a match for the
regular expression), a range (see below), <SAMP>.</SAMP> (matching any single
character), <SAMP>^</SAMP> (matching the null string at the beginning of the
input string), <SAMP>$</SAMP> (matching the null string at the end of the
input string), a <SAMP>\</SAMP> followed by a single character (matching that
character), or a single character with no other significance (matching
that character).<P>
<P>
A range is a sequence of characters enclosed in <SAMP>[]</SAMP>.  It normally
matches any single character from the sequence.  If the sequence begins
with <SAMP>^</SAMP>, it matches any single character not from the rest of the
sequence.  If two characters in the sequence are separated by <SAMP>-</SAMP>,
this is shorthand for the full list of ASCII characters between them
(e.g.  <CODE>[0-9]</CODE> matches any decimal digit).  To include a literal
<SAMP>]</SAMP> in the sequence, make it the first character (following a
possible <SAMP>^</SAMP>).  To include a literal <SAMP>-</SAMP>, make it the first or
last character.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE
>
The substitutions are the text in <VAR>string</VAR> which matches the
parenthesized subexpressions in <VAR>regexp</VAR>.  The first substitution is
the text in <VAR>string</VAR> which matches the whole regexp.  Thus, a
regular expression can contain no more than nine parenthesized
subexpressions.  Substitutions are returned as two-element lists
<CODE>[<VAR>start</VAR>, <VAR>len</VAR>]</CODE> giving the index of the matching text in
<VAR>string</VAR> and the length of the text.  When the substitutions are
ambiguous, leftmost <SAMP>*</SAMP> matches are always as long as possible.<P>
<P>
If <VAR>regexp</VAR> is not a valid regular expression, <CODE>match_regexp()</CODE>
throws a <CODE>~regexp</CODE> error.<P>
<P>
