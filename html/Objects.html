<H1>Objects</H1>

Objects in Coldmud have four characteristics: a <EM>database
reference</EM> (called a <EM>dbref</EM>) which identifies the object, a list
of <EM>parent</EM> dbrefs which determine what default behavior the object
inherits, <EM>variables</EM> which store information, and <EM>methods</EM>
which determine how the object responds to messages.  Objects refer to
each other using dbrefs, and interact with each other by sending
messages.  The objects which a Coldmud server has to work with are known
collectively as the <EM>object database</EM>.<P>
<P>
Coldmud gives special status to two objects, the <EM>system object</EM>
and the <EM>root object</EM>.  The system object is allowed to call
administrative functions and receives <CODE>startup</CODE> and
<CODE>heartbeat</CODE> messages from the server.  The root object is the only
object without parents, and is thus an ancestor of every object.<P>
