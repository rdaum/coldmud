<H2>Variables and Parameters</H2>

An object's <EM>parameters</EM> gives the names of the variables its
methods have access to.  An object's <EM>variables</EM> correspond to
parameters on that object or one of its ancestors.<P>
<P>
The function <CODE>add_parameter()</CODE> adds a parameter to an object.  Once
you have created a parameter on an object, the methods on that object
can use it to refer to a variable on that object or any of its
descendents, using the <CODE>C--</CODE> constructs described in
<A HREF="Variables.html">Variables</A>.<P>


Two objects can have parameters of the same name; a third object which
inherits from both of them will contain two separate variables for
those parameters.  Methods on the first object will refer to one
variable, and methods on the second object will refer to the other.
Likewise, variables on separate objects are distinct, even though the
methods which can access them and the parameter used by the method are
the same.<P>
<P>
Note that this system does not permit children to access the variables
used by their ancestors directly.  Objects can build on the abstractions
of their parent objects, but not their internal representations.<P>
