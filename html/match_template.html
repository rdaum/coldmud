match_template(<VAR>template</VAR>, <VAR>string</VAR>)
</PRE
>
This function matches the template <VAR>template</VAR> against the command
<VAR>string</VAR>.  The return value of <CODE>match_template()</CODE> is a list of
fields resulting from the template match, or <CODE>0</CODE> if the match fails
or if <VAR>template</VAR> is an invalid template.<P>
<P>
A <EM>template</EM> is a sequence of word-patterns and wildcards separated
by spaces, with wildcards never occurring more than one at a time.  A
<EM>word-pattern</EM> is a sequence of words separated by pipe characters
(<SAMP>|</SAMP>).  A word is a sequence of alphanumeric characters, with an
optional question mark (<SAMP>?</SAMP>) indicating the beginning of an allowed
partial match.  A <EM>wildcard</EM> is either a simple wildcard,
represented by an asterix (<SAMP>*</SAMP>) or a <EM>coupled wildcard</EM>,
represented by the three-character sequence <SAMP>*=*</SAMP>.<P>
<P>
That definition of a template is confusing, so we will now go back and
explain each component of a template in more detail.<P>
<P>
A <EM>word-pattern</EM> is a list of words separated by pipe characters.
A word-pattern matches any of the words contained in it.  The
word-pattern <CODE>"look|examine"</CODE> matches either of the words
<CODE>"look"</CODE> or <CODE>"examine"</CODE>.  The word separator for template
matching is always a space.<P>
<P>
A word can include a question mark (<SAMP>?</SAMP>) to indicate that partial
matches that extend at least as far as the question mark are okay.  The
word pattern <CODE>"look|ex?amine"</CODE> matches any of the words
<CODE>"look"</CODE>, <CODE>"ex"</CODE>, <CODE>"exa"</CODE>, <CODE>"exam"</CODE>, <CODE>"exami"</CODE>,
<CODE>"examin"</CODE>, and <CODE>"examine"</CODE>.<P>


When a word-pattern successfully matches a word in <VAR>string</VAR>, it
results in a <EM>field</EM>, or string in the returned list.  This field
contains the word which matched the word-pattern.<P>
<P>
A <EM>simple wildcard</EM> is represented by an asterix (<SAMP>*</SAMP>).  A
simple wildcard matches any number of words in <EM>string</EM>.  If the
wildcard is followed by a word-pattern in <EM>template</EM>, then it can
also match a <EM>quoted wildcard match</EM>.<P>
<P>
A quoted wildcard match is just like a <CODE>C--</CODE> string literal: it
begins and ends with a double quote (<SAMP>"</SAMP>), and can include a
literal double quote or backslash by preceding the character with a
backslash (<SAMP>\</SAMP>).  If the simple wildcard is followed by a
word-pattern, and the words in <VAR>string</VAR> that the wildcard would
match begin with a double quote, then the match must be a quoted
wildcard match or the match fails, even if the match would have
succeeded if the words were not treated as a quoted wildcard match.
However, if the words that the wildcard would match begin with a
backslash followed by a double quote, then the backslash is ignored and
the double quote and the text following it are treated as regular words.<P>
<P>
The template <CODE>"* bar"</CODE> matches any of the following strings:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
foo bar
foo baz bar
"foo bar \\ \" baz" bar
\"foo baz bar
</PRE
>
Matching against a simple wildcard produces one field, the words that
the simple wildcard matched.  If the wildcard matches a quoted wildcard
match, then the beginning and ending double quotes are stripped out of
the resulting field, as well as any backslashes used to escape
characters inside the double quotes.<P>
<P>
A <EM>coupled wildcard</EM> is represented by the three-character sequence
<SAMP>*=*</SAMP>.  It matches any sequence of words containing an equal sign
(<SAMP>=</SAMP>), and results in two fields, the text before the equal sign
and the text after it.  Any spaces surrounding the equal sign are
ignored and do not show up in the resulting fields.  The text before the
equal sign can be a quoted wildcard match (as before, if it begins with
a double quote, then it must be a quoted wildcard match or the match
fails, unless the initial double quote is escaped by a backslash).  If
the coupled wildcard is followed by a word pattern, then the text after
the equal sign can also be a quoted wildcard match.<P>
<P>
The coupled wildcard is a special feature intended for parsing 
TinyMUD command formats.  If possible, its use should be avoided.<P>
<P>
If <VAR>template</VAR> is invalid, then the match usually fails, although
this is not guaranteed.<P>
<P>
