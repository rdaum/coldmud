<H3>Simple Statements</H3>

The <EM>comment statement</EM> does nothing at all.  A comment statement
is just a comment token, which is a sequence of two slashes (<SAMP>//</SAMP>)
followed by any characters up to the end of the lines.  For instance:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
// This is a comment.
</PRE
>
The interpreter ignores comment statements completely; they are for the
benefit of human readers.  Note that comments in <CODE>C--</CODE> are actual
statements, unlike comments in <CODE>C</CODE>, which are filtered out by the
preprocessor.<P>
<P>
The <EM>expression statement</EM> evaluates an expression and discards its
value.  The syntax of the expression statement is:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>expression</VAR>;
</PRE
>
The following are expression statements:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
3;
sender().tell($sys.who());
</PRE
>
The <EM>assignment statement</EM> evaluates an expression and assigns the
value to a variable.  The syntax of the assignment statement is:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>variable</VAR> = <VAR>expression</VAR>;
</PRE
>
The interpreter assigns the value of <VAR>expression</VAR> to <VAR>variable</VAR>,
which is a local variable if it has been declared as one, or an object
variable on the current object if it has not been declared.
See <A HREF="Variables.html">Variables</A>.<P>


The <EM>compound statement</EM> allows you to treat one or more statements
as a single statement.  The compound statement has the following syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
{
    <VAR>statement1</VAR>
    <VAR>statement2</VAR>
    <VAR>.</VAR>
    <VAR>.</VAR>
    <VAR>.</VAR>
}
</PRE
>
The interpreter executes each of <VAR>statement1</VAR>, <VAR>statement2</VAR>,
<VAR>...</VAR> in turn.<P>


The <EM>return statement</EM> allows a method to stop exeuting statements
and to return a value other than the default return value of
<CODE>this()</CODE>.  The return statement can have either of the following
two forms:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
return <VAR>expression</VAR>;
return;
</PRE
>
The interpreter stops executing statements in the method and returns the
value of <VAR>expression</VAR>, or the dbref of the current object if
<VAR>expression</VAR> is not given.<P>
