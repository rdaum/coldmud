<H3>Names</H3>

A <VAR>name</VAR> is an indirect reference to an object.  Coldmud translates
names into dbrefs during method interpretation according to the
associations made using the administrative function <CODE>set_name()</CODE>.
A <VAR>name expression</VAR> is simply a name token, an identifier or string
following a dollar sign (<SAMP>$</SAMP>).<P>
<P>
When the interpreter encounters a name expression, it looks up the name
to see what dbref it has been assigned by the <CODE>set_name()</CODE>
function.  If no such assignment has been made, then the interpreter
throws a <CODE>~namenf</CODE> error; otherwise, the value of the name
expression is the dbref assigned to the name by <CODE>set_name()</CODE>.<P>
<P>
You can also use the (non-administrative) function <CODE>get_name()</CODE> to
look up a symbol as a name.<P>
<P>
The administrative function <CODE>del_name()</CODE> deletes the association
for a name.<P>
