crypt(<VAR>string</VAR>)
crypt(<VAR>string</VAR>, <VAR>salt</VAR>)
</PRE

This function performs one-way encryption on <VAR>string</VAR>, using the
host system's <CODE>crypt()</CODE> library routine.  If <VAR>salt</VAR> is
specified, then it must be a two-character string; otherwise, a salt is
chosen randomly.  The return value of <CODE>crypt()</CODE> is the encrypted
string; the first two characters of the encrypted string are the salt
used.<P>
<P>
The encryption performed by this function has the property that it is
very difficult to find a string which will produce a given result;
however, a given string and a given salt will always yield the same
encrypted string.<P>

Examples:<P>

crypt("foo", "ab")
     => "abQ9KY.KfrYrc"
