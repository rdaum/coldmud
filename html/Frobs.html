<H3>Frobs</H3>

A <EM>frob</EM> is a dictionary or list (its <EM>representation</EM>)
associated with a dbref (its <EM>class</EM>).  Frobs represent a kind of
lightweight object, with less overhead than real objects.  The
encapsulation around frobs is not as strong as the encapsulation around
real objects, and in some respects frobs are not as convenient to work
with as real objects.  In general, objects should be used for
long-lasting, complicated, changing entities, while frobs should be used
for small pieces of data.<P>
<P>
Frob construction expressions have the following syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
<<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>representation</VAR>>
</PRE
>
The result of a frob construction expression is a frob of class
<VAR>class</VAR>, which must be a dbref, with a representation
<VAR>representation</VAR>, which must be a list or dictionary.  In general,
you should only use the frob construction expression to construct frobs
of class <CODE>this()</CODE>, but this is not enforced.  The following are
valid frob construction expressions:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
<#76, #[['type, 'true]]>
<#89, ["You cannot go that way."]>
</PRE
>
Apart from operations which apply to all data types, the only operations
supported on frobs are message-passing and the <CODE>class()</CODE> function.
When you send a message to a frob, the interpreter treats it as a
message to the frob's class, with the frob's representation inserted as
the first argument.  The <CODE>class()</CODE> function returns the class of a
frob.<P>
