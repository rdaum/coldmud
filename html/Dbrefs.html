<H2>Database References</H2>

Database references are numbers which refer to objects.  When an object
is created, it is assigned a unique database reference.  Database
references cannot be changed after an object is created.<P>
<P>
In <CODE>C--</CODE>, you indicate a database reference by preceding a number
with a hash mark (<SAMP>#</SAMP>).  For instance, <CODE>#126</CODE> refers to the
object with the dbref 126.<P>
<P>
In general, programmers should not have to be concerned with database
references.  See <A HREF="Names.html">Names</A> for information on naming objects.<P>
