<H2>Tokens</H2>

The building blocks of <CODE>C--</CODE> methods are character sequences called
<EM>tokens</EM>.  There are many different types of tokens, ranging from
single characters to lines of text.  <CODE>C--</CODE> methods are assembled
from sequences of tokens.<P>
<P>
The following characters and pairs of characters are tokens:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
{ } [ ] #[ %[ ( ) (| |) (> <) .. ; , = !
- + * / % == != > >= < <= . || && ? | : @
</PRE
>
These tokens are used as operators and as punctuation in various types
of expressions.<P>
<P>
You can use <EM>identifiers</EM> as tokens and as parts of tokens.  An
identifier is a sequence of alphabetical and numeric characters or
underlines beginning with an alphabetical character or an underline.
Identifiers in <CODE>C--</CODE> are case-sensitive, so the identifiers
<CODE>car</CODE> and <CODE>CAr</CODE> are not equivalent.  The following are valid
identifiers:<P>
<P>

obj

By themselves, identifiers usually represent variables.  However,
certain identifiers have special meanings to the parser.  These
<EM>reserved words</EM> are used in writing certain kinds of statements
and expressions.  They are:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
var if else while for switch case default break continue return
catch any with handler pass to in fork atomic non_atomic
</PRE
>
(<CODE>fork</CODE>, <CODE>atomic</CODE>, and <CODE>non_atomic</CODE> are not actually used
by the current version of Coldmud, but are reserved for future use.)<P>

There are several kinds of tokens for denoting literal expressions of
various data types.  These are <EM>integers</EM>, denoted by a sequence of
digits; <EM>strings</EM>, denoted by a sequence of characters enclosed in
double quotes; <EM>dbrefs</EM>, denoted by a sharp (<SAMP>#</SAMP>) and a
number; <EM>symbols</EM>, denoted by a single forward quote (<SAMP>'</SAMP>) and
an identifier or string; and <EM>error codes</EM>, denoted by a tilde
(<SAMP>~</SAMP>) and an identifier or string.  These literals are described
more fully in <A HREF="Data_Types.html">Data Types</A>, along with the data types they
represent.<P>
<P>
A <EM>name token</EM> is a dollar sign (<SAMP>$</SAMP>) followed by an
identifier or string.  Names refer to objects indirectly; see
<A HREF="Names.html">Names</A>.<P>


Tokens which contain identifiers but begin with a distinguishing
character (that is, symbol tokens, error code tokens, and name tokens)
relax the restriction that identifiers not begin with an integer.  Thus,
<CODE>$23a</CODE> is a valid name token, even though <CODE>23a</CODE> is not an
identifier.<P>
<P>
Finally, a <EM>comment token</EM> is any text on a line after a pair of
slashes (<SAMP>//</SAMP>).  Comment tokens can be used as statements in
methods; such statements are ignored by the interpreter.<P>
