<H3>Splicing</H3>

Whenever you are writing an argument list or a list constructor
expression, you can splice a list value into the sequence of expressions
by prepending a list expression with <SAMP>@</SAMP>.  For instance, the
following method returns <CODE>['foo, 4, 5, 6, 'quux]</CODE>:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
var a;<P>
a = [4, 5, 6];
return ['foo, @a, 'quux];
</PRE
>
You use the splicing operator to pass a message along with all of its
arguments:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
pass(@args);
</PRE
>
The splicing operator is not listed in the operator precedence list
(see <A HREF="Precedence.html">Precedence</A>).  This is because it is meaningless to talk about,
say, adding a spliced list to another value.  Using the splicing
operator never causes an ambiguity.<P>
