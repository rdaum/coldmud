<H2>Example Method</H2>

Here is an example of a simple <CODE>C--</CODE> method.  This method might be
used in a mud server to handle a <CODE>tell_contents</CODE> message sent to a
container object.  Here is the code for the method:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
arg str;
var obj;<P>
for obj in (contents) {
    // Tell the string to the object.
    (| obj.tell(str) |);
}
</PRE
>

This method takes one argument, <CODE>str</CODE>, a string to send to each
object in the room.  The method uses a local variable <CODE>obj</CODE> to
traverse the list stored in the object variable <CODE>contents</CODE>.  The
body of the method is a for loop, which traverses the contents list.
For each element in the for list, this method sends a <CODE>tell</CODE>
message with the string.  The parenthesis and vertical bar delimiters
(<SAMP>(|</SAMP> and <SAMP>|)</SAMP>) surrounding the message expression mark it as
a <EM>critical expression</EM>.  Errors which occur inside a critical
expression are ignored; thus, errors which occur during the processing
of the <CODE>tell</CODE> messages won't cause the <CODE>tell_contents</CODE> method
to abort.<P>
