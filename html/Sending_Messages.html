<H3>Sending Messages</H3>

If you want to retrieve information from or modify an object other than
the current object, you can do so by sending it a message.  You can do
this with a <EM>message expression</EM>, which has the following syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>receiver</VAR>.<VAR>message</VAR>(<VAR>arg1</VAR>, <VAR>arg2</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR>)
</PRE
>
You may omit <VAR>receiver</VAR>, in which case it is assumed to be the
current object.  Otherwise, <VAR>receiver</VAR> must be an expression of
dbref or frob type, and <VAR>message</VAR> an identifier giving the name of
the message.  <VAR>arg1</VAR>, <VAR>arg2</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR> are the arguments to be
sent with the message.  The arguments are evaluated from left to right.
You must include the parentheses around the argument list, even if there
are no arguments.  The result of a message expression is the value
returned by <VAR>receiver</VAR>'s method for the message <VAR>message</VAR>.<P>
<P>
If <VAR>receiver</VAR> is a frob, then the message is sent to the frob's
class object, with the frob's representation inserted as the first
argument.  If <VAR>receiver</VAR> is a dbref, then the message is sent to
the object with that dbref.<P>
<P>
If <VAR>receiver</VAR> is not an object or frob, then the interpreter
throws a <CODE>~type</CODE> error.  If <VAR>receiver</VAR> is a dbref which does
not refer to an existing object, or if it is a frob whose class is not
an existing object, then the interpreter throws an <CODE>~objnf</CODE>
error.  If <VAR>receiver</VAR> does not have a method defined for
<VAR>message</VAR>, then the interpreter throws a <CODE>~methodnf</CODE> error.
See <A HREF="Errors.html">Errors</A> for information on how to handle errors.<P>
<P>
Here are some examples of message expressions:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
.tell("I don't see that here.");
$sys.wizards()
loc.tell_contents(args[1]);
</PRE
>
You can substitute an arbitrary expression for <VAR>message</VAR>, by
enclosing it in parentheses.  The syntax for sending an arbitrary
message is:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>receiver</VAR>.(<VAR>message-expression</VAR>)(<VAR>arg1</VAR>, <VAR>arg2</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR>)
</PRE
>
As before, <VAR>receiver</VAR> can be omitted, in which case it is assumed to
be the current object.  <VAR>message-expression</VAR> must be an expression
of symbol type, or the expression will cause a <CODE>~type</CODE> error.  You
must include the parentheses around the argument list, even if there are
no arguments.<P>
<P>
In order to prevent incidents of infinite recursion, Coldmud has a
maximum calling depth for messages.  This maximum depth is <CODE>128</CODE>
method calls in the current version.  If sending a message would exceed
the maximum calling depth, the interpreter raises a <CODE>~maxdepth</CODE>
error.<P>
