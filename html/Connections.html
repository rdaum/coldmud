<H2>Connections</H2>

As a network server, Coldmud has the ability to listen for Internet
connections on ports.  The <CODE>bind()</CODE> function instructs Coldmud to
listen on a port, with some object acting as a <EM>receiver object</EM>
for that port.<P>
<P>
Network connections have associated with them a <EM>handler object</EM>.
When a connection occurs on a port, Coldmud initially uses the receiver
object for the port as the handler object for the connection, and sends
a <CODE>connect</CODE> message to the handler object, with two arguments: a
string giving the IP address of the remote host, and an integer giving
the port of the connection on the remote host.  Because there is no way
to distinguish between connections with the same handler object, the
<CODE>connect</CODE> method on the handler object should arrange to have the
system object change either the receiver object for the port (using
<CODE>bind()</CODE>) or the handler object for the connection (using
<CODE>conn_assign()</CODE>).<P>


When text arrives from a network connection, Coldmud sends a
<CODE>parse</CODE> message to the handler object for that connection, with the
text as a buffer argument.  The <CODE>parse</CODE> method can then use
<CODE>buffer_to_strings()</CODE> to convert the buffer to a list of text
lines, if that is the usual form of input.<P>


When a network connection is terminated, Coldmud sends a
<CODE>disconnect</CODE> message to the handler object for that connection.<P>


Coldmud can also make make connections actively, using the
<CODE>connect()</CODE> function.  The third argument to <CODE>connect()</CODE>
specifies a receiver object for the new connection; the server sends a
<CODE>connect</CODE> message to the receiver object upon success, or a
<CODE>failed</CODE> message to the receiver object upon failure, as described
in <A HREF="connect.html">connect</A>.<P>
