<H2>The System Object</H2>

The system object is a special object for communicating with the Coldmud
server.  The system object has the dbref <CODE>0</CODE>.<P>
<P>
At startup time, the server sends a <CODE>startup</CODE> message to the system
object, with one argument, a list of strings giving the arguments passed
on the command line when the server was invoked.<P>
<P>
If you use the <CODE>set_heartbeat_freq()</CODE> function to enable the
heartbeat, then the server will send a <CODE>heartbeat</CODE> message to the
system object periodically.<P>
<P>
Methods on the system object can call administrative functions such as
<CODE>shutdown()</CODE> which ordinary objects are not permitted to call.  In
most databases, the system object will define methods which allow
certain authorized objects to access these functions.<P>
