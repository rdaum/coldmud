<H2>Messages and Methods</H2>

Objects interact with each other by sending <EM>messages</EM>.  Messages
have two components, a name and a list of arguments.  To see how to send
a message in a <CODE>C--</CODE> method, see <A HREF="Sending_Messages.html">Sending Messages</A>.<P>
<P>
Coldmud processes a message by looking on the recipient object and its
ancestors for a method with the same name as the message, following the
rules given in the previous section.  The recipient's method processes
the message according to its <CODE>C--</CODE> instructions, and returns a
value to the calling object.<P>
<P>
While a message is being processed, the object which received the
message is called the <EM>current object</EM>.  Only the current object's
variables can be accessed or changed by the method which processes the
message; to examine or modify another object, the method must send a
message to that object.<P>
<P>
If a method definition overrides a definition on an ancestor of the
current object with lower precedence, the overriding method can
<EM>pass</EM> the message to the ancestor; see <A HREF="Passing_Messages.html">Passing Messages</A> for
details.<P>
<P>
Methods can use the functions <CODE>this()</CODE> and <CODE>sender()</CODE> to
determine the dbrefs of the current object and the object which sent the
message to the current object.  The functions <CODE>definer()</CODE> and
<CODE>caller()</CODE> allow methods to determine the dbrefs of the objects
which define the current method and the calling method.<P>
<P>
Messages to an object are not always sent by another object; they can
also come from the server.  Coldmud sends <CODE>parse</CODE>, <CODE>connect</CODE>,
and <CODE>disconnect</CODE> messages to handler objects of connections,
<CODE>startup</CODE> and <CODE>heartbeat</CODE> messages to the system object, and
<CODE>connect</CODE> and <CODE>failed</CODE> messages to receiver objects of pending
connections generated by the <CODE>connect()</CODE> function.  When Coldmud
sends a message to an object, <CODE>sender()</CODE> and <CODE>caller()</CODE> return
the integer <CODE>0</CODE>.<P>
