<CODE>C--</CODE> provides a number of relational and logical operators.  These
operators are primarily useful for expressing conditions, since they
return either true or false, represented by the integers <CODE>1</CODE> and
<CODE>0</CODE>.<P>


The <CODE>==</CODE> and <CODE>!=</CODE> operators test for equality and inequality,
respectively, of their arguments.  Two pieces of data are equal if they
have the same type and contain the same value.  Equality of strings is
not case-sensitive, but equality of symbols is, so <CODE>("foo" ==
"fOo")</CODE> is true, but <CODE>('car == 'CAr)</CODE> is false.  Lists are equal if
all of their elements are equal.<P>
<P>
The <CODE><</CODE>, <CODE><=</CODE>, <CODE>>=</CODE>, and <CODE>></CODE> operators test whether
their left-hand arguments are less than, less than or equal to, greater
than or equal to, or greater than their right-hand arguments,
respectively.  Arguments to these operators must both be of the same
type, and must be of integer, string, or dbref type.  String comparison
is not case-sensitive, so <CODE>("fooa" < "fooB")</CODE> is true, even though
the ASCII value of <SAMP>a</SAMP> is greater than that of <SAMP>B</SAMP>.<P>
<P>
The unary <CODE>!</CODE> operator tests whether its argument is false, thus
acting as a logical not operation.<P>
