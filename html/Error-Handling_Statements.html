<H2>Error-Handling Statements</H2>

The <EM>catch statement</EM> allows you to indicate how errors should be
handled in a block.  You can use this statement when you anticipate that
an error might occur for reasons other than your programming errors.
For instance, you may anticipate being denied permission to perform an
operation, and use a catch statement to handle this error explicitly.
You can also use the catch statement to make sure that cleanup
operations are performed if an error occurs.<P>
<P>
The catch statement has the following syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
catch <VAR>error code</VAR>, <VAR>error code</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR>
    <VAR>body-statement</VAR>
with handler
    <VAR>handler-statement</VAR>
</PRE
>
You can substitute the keyword <CODE>any</CODE> for the list of errors to
indicate that you wish to catch all errors.  You can leave out the
<CODE>with handler</CODE> and the handler statement if you do not wish to do
anything in the handler.<P>
<P>
If an error listed in the error list is thrown inside
<VAR>body-statement</VAR>, the interpreter will execute the handler rather
than aborting the method.  After the handler is done, control continues
after the end of the catch statement, as if <VAR>body-statement</VAR> had
completed with no errors.<P>
<P>
Inside the handler, you can use the function <CODE>error()</CODE> to determine
the error code which triggered the handler, the function
<CODE>error_arg()</CODE> to retrieve the error argument specified by
<CODE>throw()</CODE> if one weas given, and the function <CODE>traceback()</CODE> to
retrieve a list of strings describing the propagation of the error down
the call stack.  You can use the function <CODE>rethrow()</CODE> to continue
propagating an error.<P>
<P>
Here is an example of how you might use a catch statement to
intelligently handle a <CODE>~methodnf</CODE> error from the
<CODE>list_method()</CODE> function:<P>


<PRE>
catch ~methodnf {
    code = list_method(method_name);
} with handler {
    .tell("There is no method named " + tostr(method_name) + ".");
}
</PRE

Note that critical expressions (see <A HREF="Error-Handling_Expressions.html">Error-Handling Expressions</A>)
inside <VAR>body-statement</VAR> will override the behavior of the catch
statement.  For more detail on errors in <CODE>C--</CODE>, see <A HREF="Errors.html">Errors</A>.<P>
