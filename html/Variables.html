<H3>Variables</H3>

<CODE>C--</CODE> provides two kinds of variables, <EM>local variables</EM> and
<EM>object variables</EM>.<P>


<EM>Local variables</EM> allow methods to temporarily store information.
To use a local variable in a method, declare the local variable's name
(an identifier) at the top of the method in a <CODE>var</CODE> declaration
(see <A HREF="Method_Structure.html">Method Structure</A>).  The variable's name is then an expression
whose value is the contents of the variable.  The variable initially
contains the integer <CODE>0</CODE>.<P>
<P>
To set the variable's contents, use an <EM>assignment statement</EM>,
which has the following syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>variable</VAR> = <VAR>value</VAR>;
</PRE
>
This assigns the value <EM>value</EM> to the variable <EM>variable</EM>. The
values of a method's local variables are specific to the processing of a
particular message call; when the method is invoked another time, all of
its local variables begin with the value <CODE>0</CODE> again.<P>
<P>
The following example method returns <CODE>6</CODE>:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
var a;<P>
a = 3;
return a + 3;
</PRE
>
<EM>Object variables</EM> store information for an indefinite period of
time.  You refer to object variables through parameters, which are
defined on the current method's defining object (<EM>not</EM> the current
object).  As with local variables, you can retrieve the value of an
object variable by writing the name of the parameter which refers to
that variable, and you can assign to an object variable using an
assignment statement.  You can also use the <CODE>get_var()</CODE> and
<CODE>set_var()</CODE> functions to perform these operations.  It is an error
of type <CODE>~paramnf</CODE> to refer to a parameter which does not exist on
the current method's defining object.  Object variables begin with the
value <CODE>0</CODE>.<P>
