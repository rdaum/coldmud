<H3>Conditional Statements</H3>

There are three types of conditional statements in <CODE>C--</CODE>.  The
<EM>if statement</EM> has the following syntax:<P>


<PRE>
if (<VAR>expression</VAR>)
    <VAR>statement</VAR>
</PRE
>
The interpreter evaluates <VAR>expression</VAR>.  If the value of
<VAR>expression</VAR> is true (see <A HREF="Data_Types.html">Data Types</A>), then the interpreter
executes <VAR>statement</VAR>.<P>
<P>
The <EM>if-else statement</EM> is similar to the if statement.  The
if-else statement has the following syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
if (<VAR>expression</VAR>)
    <VAR>true-statement</VAR>
else
    <VAR>false-statement</VAR>
</PRE
>
The interpreter evaluates <VAR>expression</VAR>, as before.  If the value of
<VAR>expression</VAR> is true, then the interpreter executes
<VAR>true-statement</VAR>; otherwise, it executes <VAR>false-statement</VAR>.<P>


Because the if statement and the if-else statement are similar, they can
sometimes be ambiguous.  The following code will produce unexpected
results:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
if (a)
    if (b) c;
else
    d;
</PRE
>
The indentation suggests that the <CODE>else</CODE> clause should apply to the
first <CODE>if</CODE> clause, but in fact it applies to the more recent one.
You can avoid ambiguities like this by using braces to create compound
statements out of conditional and looping statements, even if there is
only one of them.  In this case, you might write:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
if (a) {
    if (b)
        c;
} else {
    d;
}
</PRE
>
The third type of conditional statement is the <EM>switch statement</EM>,
which allows you to compare one value against a series of other values.
The switch statement is the most complicated statement type in
<CODE>C--</CODE>, so we'll start with an example:<P>


<PRE>
switch (val) {
    case 0:
        echo("The value is zero.");
    case 1 .. 10:
        echo("The value is between one and ten inclusive.");
    case 11 .. a:
        echo("The value is between eleven and a inclusive.");
    case "foo", "bar".."baz":
	echo("The value is \"foo\" or between \"bar\" and \"baz\"");
    case a .. b, c .. d, 42:
        count = count + 1;
        echo("The value is in the counted area.");
    case ~perm:
        echo("Permission denied while getting the value.");
    default:
        echo("Did not recognize value.");
}
</PRE
>
This example illustrates all of the capabilities of the switch
statement.  The expression given by <CODE>val</CODE> in the example is the
<EM>controlling expression</EM>, and is compared against each of the cases
inside the switch body.  Each case has a value or list of values to
compare against.  The values can be of any type, and need not be
constant expressions.  You can also specify ranges, using two dots
(<SAMP>..</SAMP>) to separate the lower and upper bounds.  The keyword
<CODE>default</CODE> specifies an action to perform if no cases were matched
by the controlling expression.<P>
<P>
Here is a more formal description of the syntax of the switch statement:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
switch (<VAR>controlling-expression</VAR>) {
    case <VAR>expr-or-range</VAR>, <VAR>expr-or-range</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR>:
        <VAR>statements</VAR>
    case <VAR>expr-or-range</VAR>, <VAR>expr-or-range</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR>:
        <VAR>statements</VAR>
    <VAR>.</VAR>
    <VAR>.</VAR>
    <VAR>.</VAR>
    default:
        <VAR>default-statement</VAR>
}
</PRE
>
When executing a switch statement, the interpreter scans through the
list of cases and compares <VAR>controlling-expression</VAR> against each of
the lists of values in the cases, evaluating the value lists from left
to right until there is a match.  The lower and upper bounds of ranges
must be of the same type and must be either integers or strings, or the
interpreter will throw a <CODE>~type</CODE> error.  When the interpreter finds
a match, it will execute the statement for that case.  The interpreter
will not continue checking cases after a match.<P>
<P>
If the interpreter does not find a match, it will execute
<VAR>default-statement</VAR>, the statement corresponding to the default
case.  You do not need to provide a default case if you do not wish to
provide a default action.<P>
<P>
<CODE>C</CODE> programmers should note that switch statements in <CODE>C--</CODE>
differ from switch statements in <CODE>C</CODE> in several respects.  Because
case values do not have to be constants, they may conflict, in which
case the first match will take precedence.  Also, there is no
fall-through in <CODE>C--</CODE> switch statements; only the statements
corresponding to the matching case will be executed.  Because there is
no fall-through, the <CODE>break</CODE> statement does not apply to switch
statements.  Finally, the default case must be placed last in the list
of cases if it is given.<P>
