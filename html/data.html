data(<VAR>dbref</VAR>)

This function retrieves all the variables on the object given by the
dbref <VAR>dbref</VAR>.  The return value is a dictionary whose associations
are between ancestors of the object and subdictionaries giving the
variable values for each ancestor's parameters.  Each subdictionary's
associations are between parameters (expressed as symbols) of the
ancestor in question (as symbols) and the values of the variables
corresponding to those parameters.  Thus, if the object given by
<VAR>dbref</VAR> defines a variable corresponding to a parameter
<VAR>parameter</VAR> on an ancestor <VAR>ancestor</VAR>, then
<CODE>data(<VAR>dbref</VAR>)[<VAR>ancestor</VAR>][<VAR>parameter</VAR>])</CODE> is the value
of that variable.<P>
<P>
The subdictionaries in the dictionary returned by <CODE>data()</CODE> only
contains <CODE>[<VAR>parameter</VAR>, <VAR>value</VAR>]</CODE> associations for
variables which have been assigned values on the object given by
<VAR>dbref</VAR>, not variables which have never been assigned values and
which still have the default value <CODE>0</CODE>.  Also, if no variables have
been assigned values for any parameters on an ancestor of the object
given by <VAR>dbref</VAR> (as is the case when the ancestor has no
parameters), then there will not be an association for that ancestor in
the dictionary returned by <CODE>data()</CODE>.  Neither the keys in the
dictionary returned by <CODE>data()</CODE> nor the parameters in the
subdictionaries have any particular ordering.<P>
<P>
If <VAR>dbref</VAR> is not the dbref of an object, then <CODE>data()</CODE> throws
an <CODE>~objnf</CODE> error.<P>
