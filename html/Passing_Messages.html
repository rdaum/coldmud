<H3>Passing Messages</H3>

A method can pass control of a message to a different ancestor of the
current object using a <EM>pass expression</EM>, which has the following
syntax:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
pass(<VAR>arg1</VAR>, <VAR>arg2</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR>)
</PRE
>
The arguments are evaluated from left to right.  The result of this
expression is the result of calling the ``next'' method with the
arguments <VAR>arg1</VAR>, <VAR>arg2</VAR>, <VAR>...</VAR>.  The ``next'' method is
defined as the method which would be called if the current method, and
any other methods which have already passed control of the message, were
not defined.  This method may not be defined on an ancestor of the
current object; you should, in general, not depend on a specific method
being called when you use a pass expression.<P>
<P>
The called method sees the same current object, sender, and caller as
the current method.<P>
<P>
The pass expression can cause a <CODE>~methodnf</CODE> errors if the called
method does not exist.  See <A HREF="Errors.html">Errors</A> for information on how to
handle errors.<P>
