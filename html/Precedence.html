<H4>Precedence</H4>

It is easy to write an expression whose order of evaluation is unclear.
For instance, the expression <CODE>a - b + c</CODE> could be parsed as
<CODE>(a - b) + c</CODE> or as <CODE>a - (b + c)</CODE>.  To resolve these
conflicts, each operator has two properties: <EM>precedence</EM> and
<EM>association</EM>.<P>


<EM>Precedence</EM> determines whether an operator binds more tightly than
another operator; for instance, <CODE>a + b * c</CODE> is equivalent to
<CODE>a + (b * c)</CODE> because multiplication has higher precedence than
addition.<P>
<P>
<EM>Association</EM> determines whether operators at the same precedence
level associate left to right or right to left; <CODE>a - b - c</CODE> is
equivalent to <CODE>(a - b) - c</CODE> because subtraction associates left to
right.<P>
<P>
Here is a list of operators grouped by precedence, in order from highest
precedence to lowest:<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>.</CODE>
<LI><CODE>[]</CODE>
<LI><CODE>!</CODE> and unary <CODE>-</CODE>
<LI><CODE>* / %</CODE>
<LI><CODE>+ -</CODE>
<LI><CODE>== != > >= < <=</CODE>
<LI><CODE>in</CODE>
<LI><CODE>&&</CODE>
<LI><CODE>||</CODE>
<LI><CODE>?|</CODE>
</UL>

All operators associate from left to right except the <CODE>&&</CODE>,
<CODE>||</CODE>, and <CODE>?|</CODE> operators, which associate from right to left.
You can always use parentheses (<SAMP>(</SAMP> and <SAMP>)</SAMP>) to specify the
order of evaluation explicitly.<P>
