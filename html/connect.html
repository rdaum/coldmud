connect(<VAR>address</VAR>, <VAR>port</VAR>, <VAR>receiver</VAR>)
</PRE

This function establishes a connection to the remote Internet host named
by <VAR>address</VAR> (a string giving the IP address of the remote host) at
the port <VAR>port</VAR>.<P>
<P>
If <VAR>address</VAR> is not a valid IP address, then <CODE>connect()</CODE> throw
an <CODE>~address</CODE> error.  If a socket cannot be created for the
connection, then <CODE>connect()</CODE> throws a <CODE>~socket</CODE> error.
Otherwise, <CODE>connect()</CODE> attemptes to connect to the remote host and
returns 1 immediately; it does not wait to see if the connection attempt
succeeded.<P>
<P>
If the connection succeeds, then the server will send the object
<VAR>receiver</VAR> a <CODE>connect</CODE> message, with one argument the task ID
of the task which called <CODE>connect()</CODE> (see <A HREF="task_id.html">task_id</A>).
<VAR>receiver</VAR> then becomes the handler object for the connection, and
receives <CODE>parse</CODE> messages when lines arrive from the connection, as
well as a <CODE>disconnect</CODE> message when the connection terminates.<P>
<P>
If the connection fails, then the object <VAR>receiver</VAR> will receive a
<CODE>failed</CODE> message with two arguments, the task ID of the task which
called <CODE>connect()</CODE>, and an error code: <CODE>~refused</CODE> indicates
that the connection was refused, <CODE>~net</CODE> indicates that the network
of the remote host could not be reached, <CODE>~timeout</CODE> indicates that
the connection attempt timed out, and <CODE>~other</CODE> indicates that some
other error occurred.<P>
