This program borrows many ideas from LambdaMOO, written by Stephen
White and Pavel Curtis, and COOLMUD, written by Stephen White.

The database routines in this code in chunk.c originate from code by
Marcus J. Ranum, although only the block allocation algorithm is
currently similar to his code.  The cache algorithm also uses his
ideas.

The regular expression matcher used by Coldmud (regexp.c) was written
by Henry Spencer.

Numerous people have contributed valuble ideas and debugging effort.
Among them are Jay Carlson, Erik Ostrom, Matthew Rhoten, Loyd
Blankenship, Gregory Blake, Jeff Prothero, Nils McCarthy, Brandon
Gillespie, Ron Strait, Alex Stewart, Jordan Baker, Ryan Daum, Doug
Orleans, Matthew Gray, and Scott Dickenshied.
